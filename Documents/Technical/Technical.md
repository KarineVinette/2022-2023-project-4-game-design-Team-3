## Overview

The goal of this project gives us more freedom than the previous ones: we need to create a small but functional video game that is bug-free and polished. We could choose the technologies to proceed with the realization of the game.



## The game

The game in question is called Ronin's Revenge. 

This is a 2D side scroller action game where you play as a samurai named Kazuo during feudal Japan's era. The player's objective is to cross a level where he must defend himself against enemies with his katana. 

This is a hardcore game where the player has only one life and will have to start all over again in case of a Game Over. In addition, he has a time limit of 10 minutes to reach the end of the game without getting killed.
