# Bug Reporting Database

To keep track of all reported bugs, a **Google Sheets database** has been created. Testers should access the database using the following link: 
|link| https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUzNZ14ELRrkcsO49dgf98qKeAu77P7QrDL7E3b3fW4/edit#gid=0.|
|---|---|

When accessing the database, testers should enter their name, the version of the game they are testing, and the results they obtained during testing. 
<br>
Any bugs that are discovered should also be entered into the database, along with their priority level and any relevant information. The development team will use this database to track and address all reported bugs.
